# EdgeVideoController 
A Microsoft Edge extension for HTML5 videos that allows the user to control playback speed and skip forward/backwards using hotkeys.

 
# First, a thank you 
Thank you to developer igrigorik. His extension on chrome was amazing, and becuase I was unable to port it, it inspired me to make my own extension. [A link to his extension on github](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed)
